CHIMP Release Notes
-------------------

Version 1.1.1 - unreleased
-------------

Added tooltip revealing username when hovering over item in list.

Version 1.1 - 2005 April 7
-----------

Reworked the underpinnings to not use the DOM as the data model (yuck!).

Ditched the old CHIMP icons. They are still included, but not used. I need
something better.

The decryption password dialog now reappears if you enter the wrong password,
so you can try again without having to browse for the file.

Version 1.01 - 2003 June 27
------------

Just a minor bug fix ... it had something to do with something being blank
causing problems, but I forget now exactly what it was. Oh well.

Version 1.0
-----------

Initial version. Fresh.
